# TLDR

High-level steps of setting up an Instagram Account for automated posting

## STEP

TIP: You might be able to do this using multiple emails BUT I recommend using the same email for each portal in the name of staying organized!

1. Create a "Professional" `Instagram` account
  - FYI: Only "Professional" accounts support automated posting
  - FYI: You can convert a "Personal" or "Creator" account to a "Professional" `Instagram` account via your account settings if you like
2. Create a `Facebook` account
  - `https://www.facebook.com/`
  - FYI: This `Facebook` account will be used to create a "business-focused" `Facebook Page` that accompanies the `Instagram` account so I recommend using the same email that you used to create the `Instagram` account
3. In order to qualify for automation, an `Instagram` account has to be linked to a `Facebook Page`. So create a `Facebook Page` in your `Facebook` account
  - `https://www.facebook.com/pages/creation`
4. Next create a `Meta Business Suite` account using the same email you used to create the `Facebook` account
  - `https://business.facebook.com/`
5. Create a `Business portfolio` inside of your `Meta Business Suite` account
6. After creating a `Business Portfolio`, go to the settings section of your `Meta Business Suite` account to link everything together
  - You should see a left side nav menu with a number of options including: `Business porfolio info`, `Users`, `Accounts`, etc.
  - Go to the `Accounts` sub page
  - Nested under the `Accounts` options you should see: `Pages`, `Ad accounts`, `Business asset groups`, `Apps`, `Instagram accounts`, `Whatsapp Accounts`, etc.
7. Then click on the `Pages` option nested under the `Accounts` left side nav option
  - You should see a button that says `Add` > `Add an existing Facebook Page` to be taken to a wizard where you can link your `Facebook Page` with your `Meta Business Suite` account
8. Then click on the `Instagram accounts` option nested under the `Accounts` side nav option
  - You should see a button that says `Add` to be taken to a modal where you can link your `Instagram` account with your `Meta Business Suite` account
9. After both your `Facebook Page` AND your `Instagram` account is linked with your `Meta Business Suite` account you can do the finally step of "connecting" your "Professional" `Instagram` account with your `Facebook Page`

Then your `Instagram` account is set up to support automated posting via the Instagram API!
